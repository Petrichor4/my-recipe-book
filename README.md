# my-recipe-book
My recipes book is a collaboration to accomplish the arduous task of keeping orginized in the kitchen.
We built the app to easily store and orginize recipes in a beautiful and easy to navigate way to minimize the hassel that comes with cooking.
We learned that we needed this app more than we thought we would.
